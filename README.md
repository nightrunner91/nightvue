# What is NightVue?
NightVue is a development framework for Vue.js 2.x. Its main feature is the absence of popular integrated components (buttons, forms, cards, dropdowns, modal windows, etc.) and the minimum number of preset styles. While many other frameworks offer ready-made UI solutions, NightVue gives you the maximum freedom to develop your own web interfaces. In fact, it is a set of useful tools for developers who like to do everything themselves.

The ideological basis of the framework is the most useful utilities from Bootstrap 4.x, many of which have been finalized and improved. NightVue uses best practices from Material Design 2 throughout. The framework is powered by Vue CLI 4.x, one of the most convenient tools for developing with Vue.js.
